### LAI 677: Survey of Topics in K12 Computer Science {#lai_677}

This course provides an overview of the content knowledge topics taught in 
K12 computer science. Introductory programming skills are required, as code
is used as one medium of exploration for these topics alongside articles and 
lectures. 
Classrooms are considered as nodes within broader learning ecologies, and 
emphasis is placed on the relevance of topics to interdisciplinary and connected 
K12 CS pedagogy. 

#### Course status

This would be a new course offered by the Department of Learning and Instruction. It has not yet been 
formally proposed.
