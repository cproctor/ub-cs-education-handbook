## LAI 515: Action Research to Improve Teaching and Learning {#lai-515}

The purpose of this course in action research is threefold: (1) to understand promising practices in the teaching and learning based on current scholarship; (2) to become competent, critical readers of action and interpretive research on teaching and learning; (3) to engage in a small-scale classroom study (or small-group adolescent study) to explore action research as a means of pursuing questions of teaching and learning to improve practice. Emphasis throughout will also be on understanding the assumptions and theories underlying research and drawing implications for teaching and learning in diverse classroom contexts. This class is appropriate for Ph.D. and Master's students interested in the role of action research to improve classroom practice. (Note: those who are not currently teaching, you will have opportunities to collaborate with currently practicing teachers or developing a practical plan, given your situation.)

Students in the CS teacher preparation program will use this course to design an interdisciplinary
CS learning experience, which they will subsequently implement in [LAI 516](#lai-516): 
CS Capstone. 

LAI 515 satisfies 25 hours of the 50-hour practicum requirement for the 
[Advanced Certificate Track for In-Service Teachers](#advanced-certificate-track-for-in-service-teachers).
