## LAI 667: Field Experience {#lai_667}

 The field experience course is a key component in the 
[Initial Certificate Track](#initial-certificate-track) and 
[Initial/Professional Certificate Track](#initial-professional-certificate-track)
tracks of the teacher education program that leads to a recommendation for an 
initial teacher certificate. A primary goal of the fall semester field experience 
is for preservice teachers to continue to develop their professional identity to 
support successful teaching experiences.  In accordance with NYS education law, 
this course also addresses the following areas: Arson and fire prevention, 
the prevention of harassment, bullying and cyberbullying, the means for 
identifying and reporting child abduction, child abuse, and child mistreatment, 
the prevention of school-related violence, and the prevention of alcohol and drug abuse.  

Throughout the course, students complete 115 hours of observation and participation, 
15 of which focus on students with disabilities.  Seven additional days of clinical 
experience are incorporated into the schedule to engage with diverse school 
communities and to observe/participate across the grade span of the certification level.  

Additional learning outcomes include:

- Teacher candidates will connect theory and practice between their developing 
  content and pedagogical knowledge as related to teaching and learning in 
  Western New York preK-12 classrooms, schools, and communities
- Teacher candidates will discuss and write critically about teaching and learning
- Teacher candidates will Identify and analyze the diversity within school 
  cultures and communities with a focus on how instruction is differentiated to 
  meet the needs of all learners
- Teacher candidates will begin to develop a professional identity

  understandings of the communities their schools serve
- This course is offered in collaboration with the Office of Educator Preparation and 
  is taken in conjunction with [LAI 668: Supervised Teaching I](#lai_668).
