### LAI 525: Critical Computational Literacies

### Course description

This course centers critical computational literacies as a framework for thinking about how and why we might teach K12 Computer Science (CS). Just as schools participate in broader social systems which shape our lives and which may or may not contribute to a more just and peaceful society, CS is only one part of the work of a school. Our work as CS educators may be constrained by other priorities and stakeholders, and our work can also reshape the work of the school beyond the classroom. We take as our starting point the premise that CS education is currently figured in a way which gives it unusual leverage to reshape K12 educational practice.
