## LAI 573: Technology as Social Practice {#lai-573}

This course aims to clarify the roots of, and identify what is at stake in, contemporary conflicts over the development and use of technology. The first half addresses the problem of conceptualizing technology so as best to elucidate its social nature and its involvement in political and cultural processes; the second half applies this conceptual work by analyzing the way technologies and social structures mutually shape one another in a variety of specific institutional settings.
