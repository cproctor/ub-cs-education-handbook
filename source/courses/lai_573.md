### LAI 573:  Technology as a Social Practice

#### Current course description

This course aims to clarify the roots of, and identify what is at stake in, contemporary conflicts over the development and use of technology. The first half addresses the problem of conceptualizing technology so as best to elucidate its social nature and its involvement in political and cultural processes; the second half applies this conceptual work by analyzing the way technologies and social structures mutually shape one another in a variety of specific institutional settings.

#### Proposed changes

Run a CS-teacher-specific section?
Technology use as a literacy, shaping and shaped by social categories. 
Focus on what it means to understand how technology works, not just to use it. E.g. diSessa’s “material intelligence,” my “computational infrastructure,” Lynch’s “subscreenic literacies.”
What it means to design and create technologies in a CS pedagogy context.
