## LAI 508: Educational Uses of the Internet {#lai-508}

This class is an exploration of ways the Internet can be utilized in instructional settings. Beyond acquiring hands-on experience with Web searching, using Web-based tools, and developing Web-based modules, we will investigate related technical, pedagogical, cultural, and social issues, to clarify what the Internet means in the context of educational experiences: How might teaching and learning practices change with Internet uses? What is needed for successful experiences using the Internet in education? What new concerns does the Internet bring? How does the Internet relate to the cultural context of the classroom and the cultural background of teacher and learner?
