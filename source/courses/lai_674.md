## LAI 674: Seminar in Teaching {#lai_674}

Through this course students are provided a focused opportunity to reflect 
weekly on residency/student teaching experiences, supported as they explore 
their professional identities as beginning teachers, and assisted in the 
certification process and job search. These three purposes are met through 
small-group discussions facilitated by the group’s Clinical Experience Coach 
(CEC) as well as through large-group presentations led by individuals and 
panels of speakers.

Additionally, the course focuses on completing the program summative assessments.
