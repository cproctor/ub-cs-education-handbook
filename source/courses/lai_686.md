### LAI 686: Critical Computational Literacies Design Studio {#lai_686}

This course is an interdisciplinary community of practice focused on designing theoretically-grounded tools for teaching and learning K-12 computer science (CS). CS is becoming a mainstream subject in K-12 education even though how it will be defined and taught are not yet well-established. Developing tools for teaching and learning presents an opportunity to support teacher practice while enacting a vision of K-12 CS as a culturally-sustaining, justice-oriented practice, and imagining ways in which K-12 CS might contribute to broader transformation of our schools and communities. Over the semester, teams of students will articulate a learning goal and then design, build, deploy, and analyze a computational tool in partnership with a school or community organization.
