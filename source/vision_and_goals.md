# Vision and goals

## Program vision

UB's Computer Science Education Program prepares graduates to be 
effective teachers to all of their students, supporting their 
intellectual growth, future opportunities, and ability to use CS to 
further their existing goals. Graduates will join a community of 
practice committed to redesigning schools and the discipline of K12 CS
so they better reflect the priorities, values, and cultures of the 
communities they serve while incorporating what we know about 
equitable teaching and learning in the digital age. 

## Program outcomes

Every track in the Computer Science Education Program is oriented to the same 
program outcomes. However, tracks focus on different learning goals because they expect
incoming students to already have certain competencies.
For example, the [Advanced Certificate track](#advanced-certificate) expects
incoming students to have a strong foundation in pedagogical knowledge, while the 
[UB Teach](#ub-teach-track), [Initial](#initial-certificate-track), 
[Professional](#professional-certificate-track), and 
[Initial/Professional](#initialprofessional-certificate-track) tracks
expect incoming students to have a strong foundation in CS content knowledge. 

The program outcomes are aligned with 
[New York's Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf), 
[New York's requirements for teaching a special subject](http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/general-and-program-specific-requirements-teaching-special-subject), as well as
[CSTA's Standards for CS Teachers](https://csteachers.org/page/standards-for-cs-teachers-interactive) 
(See [Appendix I](#appendix-i-alignment-of-program-outcomes-with-csta-standards) for 
alignment with CSTA Standards for CS Teachers).

### CS Content Knowledge

The content knowledge outcomes of UB's Computer Science Education Program
are aligned with four of the five core concepts defined by 
[New York's Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf). The final 
concept, "Digital literacy," is addressed in the pedagogical content knowledge 
outcomes below.

- CK1: Impacts of computing
- CK2: Computational thinking
- CK3: Networks and system design
- CK4: Cybersecurity

### Pedagogical Knowledge

Pedagogical knowledge outcomes for CS teachers are defined by New York's 
[requirements for teaching a special subject](http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/general-and-program-specific-requirements-teaching-special-subject). 
Several of New York's PK standards are addressed by PCK and L standards in UB's program outcomes.

- PK1: Human development
- PK2: Learning
- PK3: Supporting students with disabilities
- PK4: Language acquisition and literacy
- PK5: Curriculum and instruction
- PK6: Professional practice and obligations

### Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Pedagogical content knowledge is knowledge of how a specific discipline is learned and how it can be 
effectively taught. The outcomes below are the central pedagogical practices emphasized by UB's 
Computer Science Education Program. 

- PCK1: Computing as a literacy
- PCK2: Supporting learner identities
- PCK3: Shaping the learning environment
- PCK4: Teaching with computational media
- PCK5: Feedback and assessment

### Leadership

In many cases, computer science teachers will be helping to lead and design the courses, 
departments, and fit of computer science within the school. UB's Computer Science Education 
Program acknowledges how the pandemic has surfaced and exacerbated 
long-standing inequities while opening the potential for substantial change in the 
structure of schools and their roles within communities and within the economy, 
which CS is well-positioned to help lead. 

- L1: Equity and opportunity
- L2: Connected learning
- L3: Interdisciplinary connections
- L4: Design and research

## Summative assessments

### New York state teacher certification exams

Passing scores on the following [NYSTCE exams](https://www.nystce.nesinc.com/)
are required for initial certification. These exams will be required for graduates of 
the [UB Learns Track](#ub-learns-track), the [Initial Certificate Track](#initial-certificate-track),
and the [Initial/Professional Certificate Track](#initial-professional-certificate-track).

- edTPA
- Educating All Students (EAS) test
- Content Specialty Test (CST) in CS

The NYSTCE content specialty exam in CS is currently under development. New York has historically 
waived exam requirements while they are under development.

### Teacher Performance Assessment Portfolio

Teacher candidates in the
[UB Learns Track](#ub-learns-track), the 
[Initial Certificate Track](#initial-certificate-track), and the 
[Initial/Professional Certificate Track](#initial-professional-certificate-track)
are required to complete the Teacher Performance Assessment Portfolio.

### Vision statement

Additionally, candidates will articulate their vision for K-12 computer science education and 
how they intend to pursue it. This is intended to be a practical document, useful for writing 
an employment cover letter, starting an organization, and writing grants. The practice of 
drafting, workshopping, and sharing vision statements will also be the foundation of an ongoing 
community of practice. The vision statement should address:

- A definition of computer science, explaining who this definition will serve and why they 
  might find it valuable. 
- A design for computer science education, justified in terms of why it is the right design 
  for those it will serve. The scale of the design could vary, from how one CS course might 
  be integrated into a school to how CS could be embedded into a community, a career, or a 
  broader project of activism. 
- A roadmap for how this might be achieved. This should be realistic and actionable. 

## Continuous improvement

The CS Teacher Preparation Program will engage in a process of continuous improvement, 
collecting and anaylzing data around program outcomes and engaging in regular 
self-assessment and external evaluation in dialogue with all program stakeholders. 
Data collected will include matriculation and graduation statistics, student course evaluations,
and course summative assessments aligned with program outcomes. 
These processes will center on two annual retreats, one at the beginning of the academic year
and one toward the end of the academic year. All program faculty and staff will be invited, as well
as representatives of partner schools and communities and external colleagues also involved in 
CS teacher preparation. These retreats will provide opportunities to surface issues and consider 
program-level changes which could address them.
