## Vision and Goals

### Program Vision

UB's Computer Science Education Program prepares graduates to be 
effective teachers to all of their students, supporting their 
intellectual growth, future opportunities, and ability to use CS to 
further their existing goals. Graduates will join a community of 
practice committed to redesigning schools and the discipline of K12 CS
so they better reflect the priorities, values, and cultures of the 
communities they serve while incorporating what we know about 
equitable teaching and learning in the digital age. 

### Program Outcomes

Every track in the Computer Science Education Program is oriented to the same 
program outcomes. However, tracks have different learning outcomes because they expect
incoming students to already have certain competencies.
For example, the [Advanced Certificate track](#advanced-certificate) expects
incoming students to have a strong foundation in pedagogical knowledge, while the 
[UB Teach](), [Initial](), [Initial/Professional](), and [Professional]() tracks 
expect incoming students to have a strong foundation in CS content knowledge. 

#### CS Content Knowledge

The content knowledge outcomes of UB's Computer Science Education Program
are aligned with four of the five core concepts defined by 
[New York's Computer Science and Digital Fluency Standards](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf). The final 
concept, "Digital literacy," is addressed in the pedagogical content knowledge 
outcomes below.

- Impacts of computing
- Computational thinking
- Networks and system design
- Cybersecurity

#### Pedagogical Knowledge

Pedagogical knowledge outcomes for CS teachers are defined by New York's 
[requirements for teaching a special subject](http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/general-and-program-specific-requirements-teaching-special-subject). They include:

- Human development
- Learning
- Supporting students with disabilities
- Language acquisition and literacy
- Curriculum and instruction
- Classroom use of technology
- Assessment
- Education in society
- Professional practice and obligations

#### Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Pedagogical content knowledge is knowledge of how a specific discipline is learned and how it can be 
effectively taught. The outcomes below are the central pedagogical practices emphasized by UB's 
Computer Science Education Program. 

- Computing as a literacy
- Supporting learner identities
- Shaping the learning environment
- Teaching with computational media
- Feedback and assessment

#### Leadership

In many cases, computer science teachers will be helping to lead and design the courses, 
departments, and fit of computer science within the school. UB's Computer Science Education 
Program acknowledges how the pandemic has surfaced and exacerbated 
long-standing inequities while opening the potential for substantial change in the 
structure of schools and their roles within communities and within the economy, 
which CS is well-positioned to help lead. 

- Equity and opportunity
- Connected learning
- Interdisciplinary connections
- Design and research
