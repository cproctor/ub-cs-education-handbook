### Audience

The Initial Certificate Track is suitable for anyone with a content knowledge background in CS
who wishes to become a CS teacher. Graduates earn a Certificate of Advanced Study 
in Computer Science and an institutional recommendation for a NYS Initial Certification in CS, 
which qualifies the holder to teach CS in New York schools. 

### Admission requirements

Please see the [program web site](#TODO) for updates and details on application. 

- **An undergraduate degree** from an accredited institution
- **Content knowledge**:
  - Either an undergraduate major in CS or a related field, or 
  - 12 credit hours of CS satisfying the [content knowledge program outcomes](#cs-content-knowledge)
- **Test scores**[^1]: GRE or MAT scores from tests taken within five years
- **Contact information for two references**
- **Unofficial transcripts from all colleges attended**. (UB transcripts are automatically submitted for current UB students and alumni.)
- **Statement of education and career goals**

[^1]: Graduate Record Exam (GRE) or Miller Analogies Test (MAT) scores are required from tests taken within the last five yearsâ€”including verbal, quantitative and writing sections. Please use institution code 2925 and department code 3101.  While GRE/MAT scores are not demonstrated to be predictive of student success in our program, by statutory regulation we are required to have a standardized admission test score on file as part of your application. 

### Learning outcomes

The Initial Certificate Track learning outcomes are aligned with the overarching 
[CS Education Program outcomes](#program-outcomes). Incoming students are expected to 
already have a strong content background in computer science.
