### Audience

The Professional Certificate Track is available to teachers holding initial certification in Computer Science wishing to earn professional certification. This track requires one year of full-time coursework.

### Admission requirements

- **Initial NY teacher certification** in Computer Science
- **Application essay** focused on vision for CS education
- **Recommendation letter** focused on preparation to succeed and potential for impact

### Learning outcomes

The Initial Certificate Track learning outcomes are aligned with the overarching 
[CS Education Program outcomes](#program-outcomes). Incoming students are expected to 
already have a strong content background in computer science as well as a strong background
in pedagogical knowledge. This track emphasizes the synthesis of content knowledge and pedagogical 
knowledge into CS pedagogical content knowledge and leadership.
