## Professional Certificate Track

```{.graphviz}

  init_cert [label="Teachers holding\n initial certificate in CS"]
  professional [label="Professional coursework" shape="box"]
  pro_cert_outcome [label="EdM\n Recommendation for NYS Professional Certificate in CS\n Qualified to teach CS in NY"]

  init_cert -> professional -> pro_cert_outcome;
}
```

**The Professional Certificate Track is not currently available**. Very few teachers currently hold 
Initial Certificates in CS, so demand for this track will be limited for at least the next several years. 
Prospective students interested in the Professional Certificate Track are
invited to contact Dr. Chris Proctor ([chrisp@buffalo.edu](mailto:chrisp@buffalo.edu)) for the latest 
updates on the program.
