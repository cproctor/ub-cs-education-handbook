### Audience

The Advanced Certificate track is designed for New York teachers currently holding 
a teaching certificate in another discipline. 
This program builds on teachersâ€™ expertise, experience, identities, and 
commitments to grow into a new subject area. There are no content knowledge 
prerequisites, however the program will require teachers to complete college-level 
CS coursework and will draw on existing pedagogical knowledge and 
pedagogical content knowledge in their current disciplines.

The Advanced Certificate Track is designed to be completed remotely by working 
professionals at their own pace. 

### Admission requirements

- **Initial or Professional NY teacher certification** in any discipline
- **Teaching experience** (minimum one year recommended)
- **An ongoing context of practice** (classroom teaching, club) 
- **Application essay** focused on vision for CS education
- **Statement justifying preparation for CS coursework**
- **Recommendation letter** focused on preparation to succeed and potential for impact

### Learning Outcomes

The Advanced Certificate learning outcomes are aligned with the overarching 
[CS Education Program outcomes](#program-outcomes).

#### CS Content Knowledge

The Advanced Certificate track prioritizes CS content knowledge.

- Impacts of computing
- Computational thinking
- Networks and system design
- Cybersecurity
- Digital literacy

#### Pedagogical Knowledge

Teachers entering the Advanced Certificate track are expected to have a strong foundation in 
pedagogical knowledge. There are no learning outcomes in this area.

#### Pedagogical Content Knowledge in CS

The Advanced Certificate track focuses on adapting teachers' existing pedagogical content knowledge 
to CS.

- Computing as a literacy
- Supporting learner identities
- Shaping the learning environment
- Teaching with computational media
- Feedback and assessment

#### Leadership

- Equity and opportunity
- Connected learning
- Interdisciplinary connections

### Coursework

The Advanced Certificate consists of five courses and a total of 15 credit hours. 

#### Required courses

- [LAI XXX](#lai-XXX): The Pedagogy of Programming
- [LAI YYY](#lai-YYY): Survey of Topics in K12 Computer Science
- [LAI 525](#lai-525): Critical Computational Literacies
- [LAI 700](#lai-700): CS Education Capstone

#### Elective

Additionally, students will choose one of the following electives:

- [LAI 573](#lai-573): Technology as a Social Practice, recommended for elementary teachers.
- [LAI 508](#lai-508): Educational Uses of the Internet, recommended for secondary teachers.
- [LAI 686](#lai-686): Critical Computational Literacies Design Studio, recommended for 
  teachers interested in educational technology design.
- [DEE 520](#dee-520): Computing Education Research, recommended for teachers interested in 
  participating in research on computing education.
- A graduate-level CSE course. Recommended for students with strong content background, especially 
  those interested in teaching Advanced Placement courses.

The following table aligns Advanced Certificate Track learning outcomes with courses 
providing summative assessments of this learning.

### Summative Assessments

#### Performance assessment

Candidates will demonstrate competency in CS content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge 
by completing a performance assessment to be completed during the capstone course. This will 
involve two tasks which will require access to an authentic teaching context. 

- Planning and reflective practice: Outline a curriculum unit and plan one lesson in detail, 
  aimed at supporting a core CS practice. Teach and record the lesson. Then reflect on how 
  your pedagogical practices supported student practices. 
- Analyzing student learning: Design a formative assessment aligned with a core CS concept. 
  Teach one or more lessons and administer the assessment. Analyze two student work samples 
  for evidence of learning, areas for growth, and possible teacher responses. 

#### Vision statement

Additionally, candidates will articulate their vision for K-12 computer science education and 
how they intend to pursue it. This is intended to be a practical document, useful for writing 
an employment cover letter, starting an organization, and writing grants. The practice of 
drafting, workshopping, and sharing vision statements will also be the foundation of an ongoing 
community of practice. The vision statement should address:

- A definition of computer science, explaining who this definition will serve and why they 
  might find it valuable. 
- A design for computer science education, justified in terms of why it is the right design 
  for those it will serve. The scale of the design could vary, from how one CS course might 
  be integrated into a school to how CS could be embedded into a community, a career, or a 
  broader project of activism. 
- A roadmap for how this might be achieved. This should be realistic and actionable.
