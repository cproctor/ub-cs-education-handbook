The NYSED [requirements for certification in a special subject](http://www.nysed.gov/college-university-evaluation/general-and-program-specific-requirements-teaching-special-subject), including CS, require 100 hours of field experiences, then 40 days of student teaching, with the following exception: 

> Limited Exemption for candidates with prior teaching experience:
>
> A candidate who is enrolled in a graduate-level program leading to certification in one or more certificates shall be  exempt from the requirements for clinical experiences if such candidate satisfies one or more of the following conditions: 1) they have completed a New York State registered teacher preparation program prior to enrollment and hold an Initial and/or Professional certificate 2) hold National Board certification or 3) have at least one year of effective teaching under a valid New York State or out-of-state teaching license or certificate.
>
> Clinical experience requirements for candidates that qualify for the limited exemption:
>
> The clinical experience shall require the candidate to complete at least 50 clock hours of student teaching or practica, where such experiences focus on the applicable program-specific pedagogical core requirements for the special subject certificate and must occur with actual students in the special subject educational settings.

The [August 2022 Office of Higher Education Educator Preparation Newsletter](https://www.highered.nysed.gov/pdf/ohenewsletter083122.pdf) clarified that:

> candidates may engage in remote learning with students during their field experiences and student teaching if they are placed in schools that utilize this method of learning, as long as the clinical experiences meet the program requirements and teacher preparation program regulations.

[A memo dated December 1, 2022](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/college-university-evaluation/ohe-memo-alt-models-flexilbilty.pdf) clarified that "remote learning experiences with students" is appropriate for satisfying practica requirements.

"Practica" and "student teaching" are defined in Section 52.21 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education: 

> (xi) Practica means structured, college-supervised learning experiences for a student in a teacher education program in which the student teacher practices the skills being learned in the teacher education program through direct experiences with individual students, or with groups of students. These skills are practiced under the direct supervision of the certified teacher who has official responsibility for the students.
>
> (xiii) Student teaching means a structured, college-supervised learning experience for a student in a teacher education program in which the student teacher practices the skills being learned in the teacher education program and gradually assumes increased responsibility for instruction, classroom management, and other related duties for a class of students in the area of the certificate sought. These skills are practiced under the direct supervision of the certified teacher who has official responsibility for the class.
