## Introduction

Welcome to the Computer Science Education Program at UB's Graduate School of Education. This program,
one of the first in the nation, offers multiple paths to New York State teacher certification in 
Computer Science and is the context for innovative research on K12 CS teaching and learning.
Graduates will join a community of practice committed to providing high-quality CS learning opportunities
as well as transforming our education system to make it more just and equitable. 

It is an exciting time to be involved in K12 computer science education. 
Our society is starting to come to terms with the technological change brought 
about by computers over the last half century. If it was ever possible to imagine that 
technology would offer a straightforward path toward a bright future, the global pandemic
has laid bare how computers are deeply implicated in our society's inequities and violence.

At the same time, our identities, relationships, and worlds are built upon computational technologies. 
Youth today live new kinds of digital lives which were unimaginable to previous generations; our
schools need to adapt to meet their needs and welcome their identities and experiences.
A more just and democratic society depends on informed and engaged democratic participation. Today, 
that means cultivating vibrant and diverse cultures of computational literacy rooted in the communities
and cultures served by our schools. We look forward to welcoming you into this community. 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at

Sincerely, 

Chris Proctor, PhD

Director, CS teacher preparation

### Structure of this handbook

This handbook is designed for many audiences: prospective students, current students, professors and program 
coordinators, and colleagues from other departments and institutions. 

**Prospective students** should start by reviewing the [tracks](#tracks) offered in this program and 
identifying a track which matches their needs. 

**Current students** looking for details about requirements, courses, and policies should start with the 
chapter on their track. 

**Faculty and colleagues from other departments** may want to start by reading about the program's 
[vision and goals](#vision-and-goals) to understand how a single vision and set of program outcomes
guide the organization of our tracks, courses, and assessments.
